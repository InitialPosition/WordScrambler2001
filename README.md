A (very simple, insecure) monoalphabetic substitution cipher

This cipher works by replacing every letter in a string with the corresponding letter in the key alphabet, adding a changing offset.

## Use cases
- Hopefully never. There are way better, way more secure options.
- You want to understand how not to code

## Usage
Enter the message, enter your key alphabet, the initial offset and the offset added per letter. Then choose encryption/decryption mode.

## To Do
- Allow special characters / spaces
- Allow calling the program with parameters
