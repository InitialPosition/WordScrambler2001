A (very simple, insecure) monoalphabetic substitution cipher

This cipher works by replacing every letter in a string with the corresponding letter in the key alphabet, adding a changing offset.

## Use cases
- Please no

## Usage
Enter the message, enter your key alphabet (needs to contain every letter of the alphabet in upper and lowercase), the initial offset and the offset added per letter. Then choose encryption/decryption mode.

## Notes
- The algorithm currently does not accept spaces, numbers or other special characters

## To Do
- Allow special characters / spaces
- Allow calling the program with parameters
